# Write New Req [RESPONSE]
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-30-16-11-07-825
**Requirement:** build-output

---

## Response

Done. I've added three build-related requirements to the stub document:

1. **$REQ_BUILD_001** - The build script produces output in the released directory (from README "Build" section)
2. **$REQ_BUILD_002** - The released directory contains `animated-background.js` (from README "Usage" section which references this file)
3. **$REQ_BUILD_003** - The released directory contains `bg.jpg` for demo purposes (from specs/DEMO.md)

I did not include requirements for:
- How the build script works internally (implementation detail)
- "Directory is emptied with each build" (no source documents this - it was only in the stub description)
- Build strategy verification (no source specifies what strategy to use)
- Any HTML files (not explicitly documented as required outputs in README or specs)

See \"Deterministic Randomness\" in Animation model.\n    30\u2192\n    31\u2192### Range attributes (degrees of freedom)\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192Each degree of freedom has a *range* attribute expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100 (inclusive), where 0% means no movement is allowed and 100% means the full potential range is allowed.  \n    34\u2192\n    35\u2192Six attributes:\n    36\u2192\n    37\u2192- Translation (pan) ranges:  \n    38\u2192  - `pan-x`  \n    39\u2192  - `pan-y`  \n    40\u2192  - `pan-z`  \n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192- Rotation ranges:  \n    43\u2192  - `rot-x`  \n    44\u2192  - `rot-y`  \n    45\u2192  - `rot-z`  \n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192All range attributes:\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192- Type: number (float or integer), clamped to [0, 100].\n    50\u2192- Default: 0 (no motion) if omitted.  \n    51\u2192- Zero is allowed for range, but actual *velocity* for that axis must never be zero (see below).\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192#### Rotation ranges\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192For `rot-x`, `rot-y`, `rot-z`:\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192- Potential rotation interval: $$[-45^\\circ, +45^\\circ]$$ for each axis.  \n    58\u2192- Mapping from percentage to allowed interval:  \n    59\u2192  - Let $$p$$ be the attribute value in percent.  \n    60\u2192  - Allowed rotation angle magnitude is $$(p / 100) \\times 45^\\circ$$.  \n    61\u2192  - Effective allowed interval is $$[-a, +a]$$ where $$a = (p / 100) \\times 45^\\circ$$.  \n    62\u2192- Examples:\n    63\u2192  - `rot-x=\"100\"` \u21d2 rotation X allowed from $$-45^\\circ$$ to $$+45^\\circ$$.\n    64\u2192  - `rot-y=\"50\"` \u21d2 rotation Y allowed from $$-22.5^\\circ$$ to $$+22.5^\\circ$$.  \n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192#### Pan ranges for X and Y\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192For `pan-x` and `pan-y`:\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192- The wall dimensions are 10\u00d7 viewport width and 10\u00d7 viewport height.  \n    71\u2192- For an axis with 100% range:  \n    72\u2192  - 100% pan along X allows the wall to move so that:  \n    73\u2192    - At one extreme, the *left* edge of the wall is flush with the *left* edge of the viewport.  \n    74\u2192    - At the opposite extreme, the *right* edge of the wall is flush with the *right* edge of the viewport.  \n    75\u2192  - 100% pan along Y allows similar extremes for top/bottom.  \n    76\u2192- For a pan range $$p$$ in percent:  \n    77\u2192  - The actual allowed translation interval is linearly scaled so that the full 100% range corresponds to the extreme positions described above, and a smaller percentage proportionally reduces the max displacement from the center.  \n    78\u2192\n    79\u2192#### Pan range for Z (zoom)\n    80\u2192\n    81\u2192For `pan-z`:\n    82\u2192\n    83\u2192- Z pan is defined as zoom of the wall relative to the viewport.  \n    84\u2192- Potential zoom interval: from 50% to 150% of the nominal scale (1.0).  \n    85\u2192- Mapping from percentage to allowed zoom interval:  \n    86\u2192  - Let $$p$$ be the attribute value in percent.  \n    87\u2192  - At 100%, zoom can animate over the full interval [0.5, 1.5].  \n    88\u2192  - At smaller $$p$$, the zoom interval is linearly shrunk around the nominal zoom (1.0), so that 0% implies no zoom change and 100% implies full [0.5, 1.5] range.  \n    89\u2192\n    90\u2192## Animation model\n    91\u2192\n    92\u2192### State variables per axis\n    93\u2192\n    94\u2192For each axis and degree of freedom, the element maintains:\n    95\u2192\n    96\u2192- Current value (position or rotation, or zoom for Z pan).  \n    97\u2192- Velocity, expressed as a signed percentage per second of the allowed range for that axis.  \n    98\u2192\n    99\u2192Axes:\n   100\u2192\n   101\u2192- `pan-x`, `pan-y`, `pan-z` (zoom).  \n   102\u2192- `rot-x`, `rot-y`, `rot-z`.  \n   103\u2192\n   104\u2192### Velocity semantics\n   105\u2192\n   106\u2192- Velocity units: \u201cpercent of allowed range per second\u201d.  \n   107\u2192  - A velocity magnitude of 1% means that 1% of that axis\u2019s allowed range is traversed in one second.  \n   108\u2192  - Velocities may be positive or negative, determining direction.  \n   109\u2192- Zero velocity for any degree of freedom is not permitted as a stable state.  \n   110\u2192  - When velocity changes over time (see below), transitions that would result in exactly 0% must skip over 0 and choose a non-zero sign, preserving continuous motion.  \n   111\u2192\n   112\u2192### Velocity evolution\n   113\u2192\n   114\u2192- Time discretization: velocity is updated once per second (when `t` increments).\n   115\u2192- For each axis independently:\n   116\u2192  - At each one-second tick, the *magnitude* of the velocity is either increased by 1 percentage point per second or decreased by 1 percentage point per second.\n   117\u2192  - The choice is determined by `prng(t, \"{axis}-vel\")` (see Deterministic Randomness), but the result must never be 0.\n   118\u2192  - Direction (sign) is preserved except when reversed at range boundaries (see next section).  \n   119\u2192\n   120\u2192### Range boundary behavior\n   121\u2192\n   122\u2192- For each axis, motion is constrained to the computed allowed interval (rotation or pan/zoom).  \n   123\u2192- Whenever the current value reaches or attempts to exceed an endpoint of that interval:  \n   124\u2192  - The corresponding velocity for that axis is immediately reversed in sign.  \n   125\u2192  - Example:  \n   126\u2192    - For `rot-x=\"100\"`, the allowed range is $$[-45^\\circ, +45^\\circ]$$.  \n   127\u2192    - If rotation X reaches $$+45^\\circ$$, the rotation X velocity is multiplied by $$-1$$, so subsequent motion proceeds back toward $$-45^\\circ$$.  \n   128\u2192\n   129\u2192### Initialization\n   130\u2192\n   131\u2192- On element connection to the document:\n   132\u2192  - All position values start at 0 (centered for pan, no rotation for rot, nominal scale for zoom).\n   133\u2192  - Each axis with a non-zero range is assigned an initial velocity of either -1% or +1% (deterministically chosen based on the axis, see Deterministic Randomness below), ensuring continuous motion.\n   134\u2192  - Axes with range = 0 have no velocity and remain stationary.\n   135\u2192\n   136\u2192### Deterministic Randomness\n   137\u2192\n   138\u2192All \"random\" choices must be deterministic and reproducible for debugging purposes.\n   139\u2192\n   140\u2192**Time counter:**\n   141\u2192- A global tick counter `t` starts at the value of the `t` attribute (default 0) when the element connects.\n   142\u2192- `t` increments by 1 each second (at the same time as velocity updates).\n   143\u2192- On each tick, log to console: `t=0`, `t=1`, `t=2`, etc.\n   144\u2192\n   145\u2192**The `t` attribute:**\n   146\u2192- Type: non-negative integer, default 0.\n   147\u2192- When `t` is set to a value N > 0, the element fast-forwards to that state on initialization:\n   148\u2192  1. Simulate state from t=0 to t=N-1 without rendering (instant computation)\n   149\u2192  2. For each simulated tick: apply velocity to position, check boundaries, update velocity magnitude\n   150\u2192  3. Begin normal animation and console logging at t=N\n   151\u2192- This allows reproducing bug reports: setting `t=\"23\"` starts the animation in the exact state it would have reached after 23 seconds.\n   152\u2192\n   153\u2192**Seeded pseudo-random function:**\n   154\u2192- All random choices use a deterministic function `prng(t, salt) \u2192 boolean` where:\n   155\u2192  - `t` is the current tick counter\n   156\u2192  - `salt` is a unique string for each decision point (e.g., `\"panX-init\"`, `\"rotY-vel\"`)\n   157\u2192- The function must be deterministic: same `t` and `salt` always produce the same result.\n   158\u2192- Implementation may use any hash-based approach (e.g., hash `t + salt` and check if result is even/odd).\n   159\u2192\n   160\u2192**Usage:**\n   161\u2192- Initial velocity direction: `prng(0, \"{axis}-init\")` \u2192 true = +1, false = -1\n   162\u2192- Velocity magnitude change: `prng(t, \"{axis}-vel\")` \u2192 true = +1, false = -1\n   163\u2192\n   164\u2192This allows bug reports like \"looked weird at t=23\" to be reproduced exactly.  \n   165\u2192\n   166\u2192## Processing model\n   167\u2192\n   168\u2192This section describes a possible normative processing model consistent with the above semantics.\n   169\u2192\n   170\u21921. **Parsing attributes**  \n   171\u2192   - On construction or attribute changes, range attributes are parsed as floating-point percentages and clamped to [0, 100].\n   172\u2192   - `src` is resolved to an absolute URL as for regular image resources.  \n   173\u2192\n   174\u21922. **Layout and rendering**  \n   175\u2192   - The element establishes a containing block matching the viewport or its own box, and creates an internal child element representing the wall.  \n   176\u2192   - The wall element is given dimensions equal to 10\u00d7 the width and 10\u00d7 the height of the viewport or containing block.  \n   177\u2192   - The wall\u2019s background is set to the `src` image and configured to repeat in both directions, with its center aligned to the wall\u2019s center.  \n   178\u2192\n   179\u21923. **Transform application**  \n   180\u2192   - On each animation frame, transforms for pan and rotation are computed from the current state variables:  \n   181\u2192     - `pan-x` and `pan-y` map to translations along the X and Y axes.  \n   182\u2192     - `pan-z` maps to scaling (zoom) of the wall.  \n   183\u2192     - `rot-x`, `rot-y`, `rot-z` map to 3D rotations around the respective axes.  \n   184\u2192   - The combined transform is applied to the wall element, using CSS transforms or equivalent.\n   185\u2192\n   186\u21924. **Animation loop**  \n   187\u2192   - A time-based animation loop (for example, driven by `requestAnimationFrame`) integrates velocities over time to update current values along each axis.\n   188\u2192   - Once per second, a separate tick updates velocities (increase/decrease magnitude by 1% per second, skipping 0, and handling sign reversals at boundaries).  \n   189\u2192\n   190\u2192## Example usage\n   191\u2192\n   192\u2192```html\n   193\u2192<animated-background\n   194\u2192  src=\"stars.jpg\"\n   195\u2192  pan-x=\"100\"\n   196\u2192  pan-y=\"75\"\n   197\u2192  pan-z=\"50\"\n   198\u2192  rot-x=\"50\"\n   199\u2192  rot-y=\"100\"\n   200\u2192  rot-z=\"25\">\n   201\u2192</animated-background>\n   202\u2192```\n   203\u2192\n   204\u2192This example declares an `<animated-background>` that:  \n   205\u2192- Allows full horizontal panning, 75% of the vertical panning range, and 50% of the zoom range (somewhere between 50% and 150%).  \n   206\u2192- Allows 50% tilt around X, full tilt around Y, and 25% rotation around Z, with continuous velocity-based motion within those ranges.\n   207\u2192\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

     "content": "The `<animated-background>` element is a custom HTML element that renders a tiled background image on a virtual wall and animates it over time in six degrees of freedom, with each degree of freedom constrained by percentage-based attributes.\n\n## Element overview\n\n- Tag name: `<animated-background>` (autonomous custom element extending `HTMLElement`).\n- Rendering model:  \n  - Internally creates a 3D-transformed \u201cwall\u201d surface that is 10\u00d7 viewport width and 10\u00d7 viewport height.  \n  - The specified image is tiled across this wall; the wall\u2019s center aligns with the center of the image.  \n  - The visible viewport corresponds to the browser window; animation is produced by transforming the wall, not the viewport.\n\n## Attributes\n\nAll attributes are optional unless stated otherwise and use lowercase names consistent with custom element conventions.\n\n### Image source\n\n- `src` (required)\n  - Type: string (URL).\n  - Semantics: URL of the image used as the background texture of the virtual wall.\n  - Behavior:\n    - The image is tiled infinitely over the wall using a repeating pattern in both X and Y directions.\n    - The center of one tile is at the geometric center of the wall; additional tiles repeat in all directions.\n\n### Debug/replay attribute\n\n- `t` (optional)\n  - Type: non-negative integer, default 0.\n  - Semantics: Starting tick for the animation's deterministic state.\n  - Behavior: When set to N > 0, the element instantly simulates N seconds of state evolution before beginning visible animation. See \"Deterministic Randomness\" in Animation model.\n\n### Range attributes (degrees of freedom)\n\nEach degree of freedom has a *range* attribute expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100 (inclusive), where 0% means no movement is allowed and 100% means the full potential range is allowed.  \n\nSix attributes:\n\n- Translation (pan) ranges:  \n  - `pan-x`  \n  - `pan-y`  \n  - `pan-z`  \n\n- Rotation ranges:  \n  - `rot-x`  \n  - `rot-y`  \n  - `rot-z`  \n\nAll range attributes:\n\n- Type: number (float or integer), clamped to [0, 100].\n- Default: 0 (no motion) if omitted.  \n- Zero is allowed for range, but actual *velocity* for that axis must never be zero (see below).\n\n#### Rotation ranges\n\nFor `rot-x`, `rot-y`, `rot-z`:\n\n- Potential rotation interval: $$[-45^\\circ, +45^\\circ]$$ for each axis.  \n- Mapping from percentage to allowed interval:  \n  - Let $$p$$ be the attribute value in percent.  \n  - Allowed rotation angle magnitude is $$(p / 100) \\times 45^\\circ$$.  \n  - Effective allowed interval is $$[-a, +a]$$ where $$a = (p / 100) \\times 45^\\circ$$.  \n- Examples:\n  - `rot-x=\"100\"` \u21d2 rotation X allowed from $$-45^\\circ$$ to $$+45^\\circ$$.\n  - `rot-y=\"50\"` \u21d2 rotation Y allowed from $$-22.5^\\circ$$ to $$+22.5^\\circ$$.  \n\n#### Pan ranges for X and Y\n\nFor `pan-x` and `pan-y`:\n\n- The wall dimensions are 10\u00d7 viewport width and 10\u00d7 viewport height.  \n- For an axis with 100% range:  \n  - 100% pan along X allows the wall to move so that:  \n    - At one extreme, the *left* edge of the wall is flush with the *left* edge of the viewport.  \n    - At the opposite extreme, the *right* edge of the wall is flush with the *right* edge of the viewport.  \n  - 100% pan along Y allows similar extremes for top/bottom.  \n- For a pan range $$p$$ in percent:  \n  - The actual allowed translation interval is linearly scaled so that the full 100% range corresponds to the extreme positions described above, and a smaller percentage proportionally reduces the max displacement from the center.  \n\n#### Pan range for Z (zoom)\n\nFor `pan-z`:\n\n- Z pan is defined as zoom of the wall relative to the viewport.  \n- Potential zoom interval: from 50% to 150% of the nominal scale (1.0).  \n- Mapping from percentage to allowed zoom interval:  \n  - Let $$p$$ be the attribute value in percent.  \n  - At 100%, zoom can animate over the full interval [0.5, 1.5].  \n  - At smaller $$p$$, the zoom interval is linearly shrunk around the nominal zoom (1.0), so that 0% implies no zoom change and 100% implies full [0.5, 1.5] range.  \n\n## Animation model\n\n### State variables per axis\n\nFor each axis and degree of freedom, the element maintains:\n\n- Current value (position or rotation, or zoom for Z pan).  \n- Velocity, expressed as a signed percentage per second of the allowed range for that axis.  \n\nAxes:\n\n- `pan-x`, `pan-y`, `pan-z` (zoom).  \n- `rot-x`, `rot-y`, `rot-z`.  \n\n### Velocity semantics\n\n- Velocity units: \u201cpercent of allowed range per second\u201d.  \n  - A velocity magnitude of 1% means that 1% of that axis\u2019s allowed range is traversed in one second.  \n  - Velocities may be positive or negative, determining direction.  \n- Zero velocity for any degree of freedom is not permitted as a stable state.  \n  - When velocity changes over time (see below), transitions that would result in exactly 0% must skip over 0 and choose a non-zero sign, preserving continuous motion.  \n\n### Velocity evolution\n\n- Time discretization: velocity is updated once per second (when `t` increments).\n- For each axis independently:\n  - At each one-second tick, the *magnitude* of the velocity is either increased by 1 percentage point per second or decreased by 1 percentage point per second.\n  - The choice is determined by `prng(t, \"{axis}-vel\")` (see Deterministic Randomness), but the result must never be 0.\n  - Direction (sign) is preserved except when reversed at range boundaries (see next section).  \n\n### Range boundary behavior\n\n- For each axis, motion is constrained to the computed allowed interval (rotation or pan/zoom).  \n- Whenever the current value reaches or attempts to exceed an endpoint of that interval:  \n  - The corresponding velocity for that axis is immediately reversed in sign.  \n  - Example:  \n    - For `rot-x=\"100\"`, the allowed range is $$[-45^\\circ, +45^\\circ]$$.  \n    - If rotation X reaches $$+45^\\circ$$, the rotation X velocity is multiplied by $$-1$$, so subsequent motion proceeds back toward $$-45^\\circ$$.  \n\n### Initialization\n\n- On element connection to the document:\n  - All position values start at 0 (centered for pan, no rotation for rot, nominal scale for zoom).\n  - Each axis with a non-zero range is assigned an initial velocity of either -1% or +1% (deterministically chosen based on the axis, see Deterministic Randomness below), ensuring continuous motion.\n  - Axes with range = 0 have no velocity and remain stationary.\n\n### Deterministic Randomness\n\nAll \"random\" choices must be deterministic and reproducible for debugging purposes.\n\n**Time counter:**\n- A global tick counter `t` starts at the value of the `t` attribute (default 0) when the element connects.\n- `t` increments by 1 each second (at the same time as velocity updates).\n- On each tick, log to console: `t=0`, `t=1`, `t=2`, etc.\n\n**The `t` attribute:**\n- Type: non-negative integer, default 0.\n- When `t` is set to a value N > 0, the element fast-forwards to that state on initialization:\n  1. Simulate state from t=0 to t=N-1 without rendering (instant computation)\n  2. For each simulated tick: apply velocity to position, check boundaries, update velocity magnitude\n  3. Begin normal animation and console logging at t=N\n- This allows reproducing bug reports: setting `t=\"23\"` starts the animation in the exact state it would have reached after 23 seconds.\n\n**Seeded pseudo-random function:**\n- All random choices use a deterministic function `prng(t, salt) \u2192 boolean` where:\n  - `t` is the current tick counter\n  - `salt` is a unique string for each decision point (e.g., `\"panX-init\"`, `\"rotY-vel\"`)\n- The function must be deterministic: same `t` and `salt` always produce the same result.\n- Implementation may use any hash-based approach (e.g., hash `t + salt` and check if result is even/odd).\n\n**Usage:**\n- Initial velocity direction: `prng(0, \"{axis}-init\")` \u2192 true = +1, false = -1\n- Velocity magnitude change: `prng(t, \"{axis}-vel\")` \u2192 true = +1, false = -1\n\nThis allows bug reports like \"looked weird at t=23\" to be reproduced exactly.  \n\n## Processing model\n\nThis section describes a possible normative processing model consistent with the above semantics.\n\n1. **Parsing attributes**  \n   - On construction or attribute changes, range attributes are parsed as floating-point percentages and clamped to [0, 100].\n   - `src` is resolved to an absolute URL as for regular image resources.  \n\n2. **Layout and rendering**  \n   - The element establishes a containing block matching the viewport or its own box, and creates an internal child element representing the wall.  \n   - The wall element is given dimensions equal to 10\u00d7 the width and 10\u00d7 the height of the viewport or containing block.  \n   - The wall\u2019s background is set to the `src` image and configured to repeat in both directions, with its center aligned to the wall\u2019s center.  \n\n3. **Transform application**  \n   - On each animation frame, transforms for pan and rotation are computed from the current state variables:  \n     - `pan-x` and `pan-y` map to translations along the X and Y axes.  \n     - `pan-z` maps to scaling (zoom) of the wall.  \n     - `rot-x`, `rot-y`, `rot-z` map to 3D rotations around the respective axes.  \n   - The combined transform is applied to the wall element, using CSS transforms or equivalent.\n\n4. **Animation loop**  \n   - A time-based animation loop (for example, driven by `requestAnimationFrame`) integrates velocities over time to update current values along each axis.\n   - Once per second, a separate tick updates velocities (increase/decrease magnitude by 1% per second, skipping 0, and handling sign reversals at boundaries).  \n\n## Example usage\n\n```html\n<animated-background\n  src=\"stars.jpg\"\n  pan-x=\"100\"\n  pan-y=\"75\"\n  pan-z=\"50\"\n  rot-x=\"50\"\n  rot-y=\"100\"\n  rot-z=\"25\">\n</animated-background>\n```\n\nThis example declares an `<animated-background>` that:  \n- Allows full horizontal panning, 75% of the vertical panning range, and 50% of the zoom range (somewhere between 50% and 150%).  \n- Allows 50% tilt around X, full tilt around Y, and 25% rotation around Z, with continuous velocity-based motion within those ranges.\n",

For example, if `pan-x=\"30\"`, the position normally stays within -15% to +15%, but the setter allows any value in -50% to +50%.\n\nProperty names: `panXPosition`, `panYPosition`, `panZPosition`, `rotXPosition`, `rotYPosition`, `rotZPosition`.\n\n### Velocity Accessors\n\nFor each degree of freedom, expose the current velocity:\n\n```javascript\nelement.panXVelocity        // get current pan-x velocity (% of range per second)\nelement.panXVelocity = 10   // set pan-x velocity to 10% per second\n```\n\nProperty names: `panXVelocity`, `panYVelocity`, `panZVelocity`, `rotXVelocity`, `rotYVelocity`, `rotZVelocity`.\n\n## Test Process\n\nEach degree of freedom is tested independently using this process:\n\n1. Zero every range except the one being tested\n2. Set that range to 100%\n3. Set that axis position to 0 (center)\n4. Set that axis velocity to a significant value (e.g., 20% per second)\n5. Record initial position, take a screenshot\n6. Wait 1.5 seconds\n7. Record final position, take another screenshot\n8. Verify numerically: final position \u2248 initial position + (velocity \u00d7 1.5)\n9. Verify visually: the background moved as expected for that axis\n\n## Test Cases\n\n### Demo Form Test\n- Verify form is visible and centered\n- Verify glassmorphic styling (semi-transparent with blur)\n- Verify form remains stationary while background animates\n\n### Pan-X Test\n- Set `panX = 100`, all others to 0\n- Set `panXVelocity = 20`\n- Verify: horizontal movement only\n\n### Pan-Y Test\n- Set `panY = 100`, all others to 0\n- Set `panYVelocity = 20`\n- Verify: vertical movement only\n\n### Pan-Z Test (Zoom)\n- Set `panZ = 100`, all others to 0\n- Set `panZVelocity = 20`\n- Verify: uniform scaling from center\n\n### Rot-X Test\n- Set `rotX = 100`, all others to 0\n- Set `rotXVelocity = 20`\n- Verify: forward/backward tilt with perspective distortion\n\n### Rot-Y Test\n- Set `rotY = 100`, all others to 0\n- Set `rotYVelocity = 20`\n- Verify: left/right tilt with perspective distortion\n\n### Rot-Z Test\n- Set `rotZ = 100`, all others to 0\n- Set `rotZVelocity = 20`\n- Verify: in-plane rotation only\n\n### Deterministic Replay Test\n\nVerify that the `t` attribute fast-forward produces identical state to real-time animation.\n\n**Test process:**\n1. Create element with all ranges at 100%, `t=\"0\"`\n2. Wait 30 seconds (until console shows `t=30`)\n3. Record all position values: `panXPosition`, `panYPosition`, `panZPosition`, `rotXPosition`, `rotYPosition`, `rotZPosition`\n4. Remove element, create new element with same ranges but `t=\"29\"`\n5. Wait 1 second (until console shows `t=30`)\n6. Record all position values again\n7. Verify: all six position values match between step 3 and step 6 (within floating-point tolerance)\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Both paths reach t=30 with identical PRNG sequences\n- If fast-forward simulation is correct, positions must be identical\n- Tests all six axes simultaneously\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAll tests pass when each isolated test shows only the expected motion between the two screenshots, and the deterministic replay test confirms matching positions.\n",

Based on my review:\n\nFrom README.md (Section: \"Build\"):\n- Run `./code/build.py` to copy source to `./released/skrolbak/`\n\nThe stub mentions:\n1. The `./released/` directory must contain specified files and only those files\n2. The build strategy should be verified (e.g., copying files)\n3. The `./released/` directory should be emptied and re-written with each build\n\nLooking at what's actually documented:\n- README says: \"Run `./code/build.py` to copy source to `./released/skrolbak/`\"\n- specs/DEMO.md says: \"`./extart/bg.jpg` is provided for demo/testing purposes. Copy it to an appropriate directory under `./code/`.\"\n\nThe build copies source to `./released/skrolbak/`. But what files should be there? Looking at the README and specs:\n- `animated-background.js` is needed (from README usage example)\n- `bg.jpg` for demo (from specs/DEMO.md)\n- An HTML file would be needed for the demo form\n\nBased on what's documented as observable outputs, I can write requirements about what files should exist after build. Let me craft the requirements:"
